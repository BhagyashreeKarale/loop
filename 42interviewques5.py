#flow control of while loop
# 1. First the given condition is checked, if the condition returns false, the loop is terminated and the control jumps to the next statement in the program after the loop.
# 2. If the condition returns true, the set of statements inside loop are executed and then the control jumps to the beginning of the loop for next iteration.

# These two steps happen repeatedly as long as the condition specified in while loop remains true.
