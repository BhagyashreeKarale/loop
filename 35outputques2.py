#Niche diye gye code snippet ki output kya hogi?

n = 6
s = 0
i = 1

while i <= n:
    s = s + i
    i = i + 1
print (s)
#<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<OUTPUT>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>#
# 21

###note###
#if print(s) was written in alignment to s and i it would print s for every i
#as print(s) is written in alignment to while it will only print the last output.i.e.s for last i
